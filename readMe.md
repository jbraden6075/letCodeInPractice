# letCodeInPractice

## Description
### What:
letCodeInPractice is a functional automation project I'm working on while I'm unemployed.

### Why:
I wanted to keep my skills fresh and I have more time to explore and learn additional tips and tricks.

### How:
I am building a node.js project with TestCafe as the automation tool. Depending on how involved letcode.in is, I plan on commiting many types of files in order to expand my understanding of file types and the power and flexibility they can bring to the repository.

## The Whats
- Website: letcode.in
- Automation Framework: TestCafe
- Language: JavaScript
